        <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
        <p id="intro">Hi, I'm Tanner! I am a student of computer science at Weber State University, though this is my second time pursuing a bachelor's degree. I first went to BYU-Idaho and got a degree in Business Management. After a few jobs in that field, I realized I wanted to change things up. After a while I realized coding was the answer! So CS it is, and I'm doing a minor in Design for Digital Media so I can hone my creative skills in addition to the great coding stuff!</p>

        <h2>Getting to Know Tanner</h2>
        <h3>If you could sit next to anyone on a plane, who would you choose?</h3>
        <p>I'd want to sit by Weird Al Yankovic, an artist I grew up listening to and whom I still look up to. What a weird dude, what a solid guy. My humor owes a lot to his music and general comedic style, but now that I've learned a lot more about music, I would want to ask him more technical questions that he never gets in interviews.</p>
